  <h1>What is DIG?</h1>
  <p>The Decentralized Information Group works on Solid Project to give people control of their own data
  and to redecentralized the web. He is the co-founder and CTO of inrupt, the company lauched to ensure success
  of the Solid platform and its open source community and to build the ecosystem that supports it.</p>
  <h1>What is the World Wide Web Foundation?</h1>
  <p> The Web Foundation is a non-profit organisation devoted to achieving a world in which all people can use the Web 
  to communicate, collaborate and innovate freely.  The Web Foundation words to fund and coordinate efforts to defend the 
  Open Web and further its potential to benefit humanity and Tims Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Foundation. </p>
  <h1>About Tims Berners-Lee</h1>
  <h1>Career</h1>
  <p>He is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, a Web standards organization foudned inn 1944 which develops 
  interopable technology.<br>(specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. He is a Director of

  <h1>Awards</h1>
  <p>On March 18, 2013, Sir Tim, along with Vint Cerf, Robert Kahn, Louis Pouzin and Marc Andreesen 
was awarded the Queen ELizabeth Prize for Engineering<br> or "ground-breaking innovation in engineering 
that has been of global benefit to humanity.<br>" On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing 
Prize for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser,<br> and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing 
the Web to scale. The Turing Prize, also known as<br> " The Nobel Prize for Computing is considered one of the most prestigious awards

  <h1>Contributions to Society</h1>
  <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee changed the world: he invented the World Wide Web. He then gave the web to all of us for free – a move that 
sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration and innovation never seen before.<br>The Web has changed the world but that free and open web 
is now under threat. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a Web for everyone, a leveling playing field  anywhere who could access the internet could also 
use the web to learn, earn, create and dream without asking for permission.<br> But he knew this vision needed to be protected, so he founded the 
World Wide Web Foundation to defend and advance the open web as a public good and a basic right.The Web Foundation works on the front lines of change 
with 160 partner organizations in 70 countries<br> who all agree the digital divide is a central issue in combating global inequality. The Web Foundation works 
with governments, corporations and ordinary citizens to realize a world where everyone has the same rights and opportunities online — a world of digital equality.
  <h1>How Tim Berners Lee made the World Wide Web a safer placce ?</h1>
  <p>Making the internet affordable. They have set a new, ambitious benchmark for internet affordability that’s been endorsed by regional groupings, country governments and business experts alike.  Dubbed “1 for 2”, this target states that 1GB of mobile data should cost no more than 2% of average monthly income — a price point that would allow all levels of income earners to afford to connect.
Keeping the internet neutral.<br>They have helped win victories for net neutrality in the EU, India and the USA – where we’re now fighting to protect that hard-won gain.
Advocating for accountable AI & algorithms.  <br>They’re working to ensure transparency and accountability regarding how personal data is used in the digital age.  From research on political social media ads to high-level advocacy on designing algorithms for diversity to in-depth knowledge of government data management practices, we help take back control of people’s personal data and make sure there is true accountability for the decisions of machines.
Opening up government data. They shed new light on government transparency through our annual Open Data Barometer, <br>and have used the results to press governments in more than 15 countries to open up their data.
Closing the digital gender gap.<br> They've’ve conducted groundbreaking research exploring the extent and causes of the digital gender divide, and now work with local organisations in around 20 countries to design gender-responsive policies for information and communication technologies.</p>
